1. The function yoo() is calling a function who() in a C program. It was compiled using a non-traditional compiler and it's possible 
   that the procedure calling conventions were not obeyed with respect to register saving. Point out where are they not being obeyed. 
   
   The assembly code is as follows 

who:
	movq	%rdi, %rax
	subq	%rsi, %rax
	ret
yoo:
	pushq	%rbp
	pushq	%rbx
	movq	%rdi, %rbp
	movq	%rsi, %rbx
	leaq	5(,%rsi,8), %rsi
	leaq	5(%rdi), %rdi
	call	who
	imulq	%rbp, %rax
	addq	%rbx, %rax
    popq    %rbp
    popq    %rbx
    ret

   that the procedure calling conventions were not obeyed with respect to register saving. Point out where are they not being obeyed. 
   
   The assembly code is as follows

	movq	%rdi, %rax
	ret
yoo:
	pushq	%rbp

3. Show the memory layout and give the final size of these structs. You can use sizeof() function.
   In the memory layout, clearly show the memory addresses occupied by each data member, any holes within the struct or at the end.

a) struct comp {
      int a[3];
      char b[2];
      long c[2];
      double d;
      char e;
   };

b) struct comp2 {
      char a;
      long b;
      char c[4];
      int d;
   };

c) struct comp3 {
      char a[2];
      struct comp2 b;
      int c;
   };
