1. Identify the strong 'symbols' in the following two C modules
a) file1

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int buf[2] = {1,2};
extern int y;

void printStuff();

int main() {
    double x = 3.14;
    printStuff();
    x += 5.1;
    return 0;
}




b) file2

#include <stdio.h>

int foo() {
    printf("Hello\n");
}

extern int x;
int y;
int z = 1;

int main() {
    foo();
    int a = 10;
    a += 20;
}





2. Identify the weak 'symbols' in the same modules (1a and 1b)

3. An executable prog1 is created (using gcc) by static linking of an archive file libstatic.a (in addition to other dependencies like C files).
   Another executable prog2 is created by dynamic linking of a shared library libdynamic.so file (in addition to other dependencies).

   After their creation, if we delete 'libstatic.a' file, the prog1 executable still works fine.
   But if we delete 'libdynamic.so' file, the prog2 crashes immediately. Why is it so?
